- A popular Database as a Service (DBaas)
- Can be delivered as DBaaS on many clouds, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud SQL, Microsoft Azure, Heroku, and EnterpriseDb Cloud.

## The PostgreSQL architecture
- Shared memory:
  - Minimize Disk I/0
  - Access very large buffers (tens or hundreds of gigabytes worth) quickly.
  - The reduction of write-ahead log (WAL) (bulk insert)
  - Minimize contention when many users access it at the same time
  - The contents stored in the WAL buffer are written to the WAL file at a predetermined point in time.
